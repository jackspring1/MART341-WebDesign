<h1><strong>Give them a shot!</strong></h1>

    I highly reccomend these titles. It's a wide range of films from different time periods. Be warned, some of these films are extremely disturbing, however they all have a message. Some of the films are fun and lighthearted. These are all my personal favorite movies and may not be your style! Although, I would give them a shot. Thanks for viewing my opinions!
